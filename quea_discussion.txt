Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:07 PM?:
	
What are you looking for with respect to Queue.. 
	
a new Queue to be created and credentials to access the Queue from integration?
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:07 PM?:
	
yes
	
since its new integration
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:07 PM?:
	
What is the Queue name that you want to create?
 
	Maria Capalleja has joined the conference.
 
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:09 PM?:
	
Added Betty also
Maria Capalleja ?10:09 PM?:
	
hi
	
Should the name of the queue need to follow naming conventions?
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:10 PM?:
	
yes
Maria Capalleja ?10:10 PM?:
	
Satia used to create the queues
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:10 PM?:
	
Shashank is asking about the details
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:10 PM?:
	
Hi Betty
Maria Capalleja ?10:10 PM?:
	
hi!
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:10 PM?:
	
I was asking for Queue name to be created
Maria Capalleja ?10:10 PM?:
	
what is our naming convention?
	
Satia always created the queues before
	
I am not sure about the naming convention
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:11 PM?:
	
Yes.. Lokesh will be creating it going forward,,
	
But Dev team has to give the Queue name
	
Queue name convention would be 
	
Source+Destination+Data+Envrionment
	
So for Cutrale..
	
Will source be Cutrale?
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:12 PM?:
	
So in this case CutraleSAPFinanceDev?
	
SAPCutraleFinanceDev?
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:13 PM?:
	
CutraleSAPFinance-Dev 
Maria Capalleja ?10:13 PM?:
	
yes
	
that looks good
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:13 PM?:
	
there are 2 queues \
	
one for inbound to SAP and another one outbound from SAP
	
So it should be like
	
CutraleSAPFinance-Dev 
Maria Capalleja ?10:14 PM?:
	
then the other is CutraleSAPFinance-Dev
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:14 PM?:
	
CutraleToSAPFinance-Dev  and SAPToCutraleFinance-Dev 
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:14 PM?:
	
Yes
Maria Capalleja ?10:14 PM?:
	
yes
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:14 PM?:
	
Is it S3 Buckets we will be using?
	
from mule what kind of connector we need to use to connect these queue
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:15 PM?:
	
Whats your project flow.. IS the message size going to be more than 256KB?
individual message size
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:15 PM?:
	
might be
Maria Capalleja ?10:16 PM?:
	
the SAPToCutrale no, that is an small IDOC
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:16 PM?:
	
thanks betty
	
i was tying betty could answer better for this question :)
Maria Capalleja ?10:16 PM?:
	
let me take a pick in P08
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:17 PM?:
	
If there is no big payload we are look into.. Then we you SQS connector on the publisher and SQS connector on the subscriber
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:17 PM?:
	
sounds good to me
	
Betty are you ok with this?
be right back
Maria Capalleja ?10:19 PM?:
	
The biggest IDOC I see in SAP P08 has 12 segments 
	
and each segment is small
that was in January
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:22 PM?:
	
ok
	
then it may not be more than the size shashank mentioned
Maria Capalleja ?10:22 PM?:
	
hold... why Cutrale has 2 queues?
ahhhh to send the HTTP response
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:23 PM?:
	
yeah
Maria Capalleja ?10:23 PM?:
	
oh.... and can you keep that connection open in Mule?
because Tibco send the response in the same connection
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:23 PM?:
	
yeah
Maria Capalleja ?10:24 PM?:
	
then.... how do we do that?
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:24 PM?:
	
i can't connect directly from cloudhub to SAP

Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:29 PM?:
	
its a sync call from Cutrale
Maria Capalleja ?10:30 PM?:
	
yes, it is a sync call from cutrale
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:30 PM?:
	
http to Cluhdhub and waiting for response
	
:(
Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:30 PM?:
	
In that case you should use HTTP to connect to onprem..instead of Queue
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:31 PM?:
	
since its DR0 we need to use Queue
	
that is the recomended appoach which creates all kind of complications

Shashank Ramakrishnaiah ?10:31 PM?:
	
Can we get on a call.. 
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:31 PM?:
	
sure
Maria Capalleja ?10:31 PM?:
	
yes, lets open a bridge
Rajamani, Ananth (US - Dallas) ?10:32 PM?:
